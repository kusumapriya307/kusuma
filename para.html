<p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundational language for creating and structuring content on the World Wide Web. It uses a system of "tags" and "elements" to annotate text, images, and other multimedia, instructing web browsers on how to display the content. For example, the <p> tag defines a paragraph, <h1> defines a main heading, and the <a> tag creates a hyperlink to connect to other pages. It is a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it provides structure and presentation cues rather than dynamic functionality or logical processing on its own. Modern websites rely on HTML working in tandem with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for visual styling and JavaScript for interactivity, forming the core of front-end web development. </p>
